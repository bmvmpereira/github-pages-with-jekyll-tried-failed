# Welcome to this beautiful place

I'm glad you are here. This is where I am practicing so I become confident on using GitHub. 
You see, one of my goals for the year is to become a proficient python progammer with a focus on AI and DS. While doing so, I plan to keep record of the developments, lessons learned and mistakes made. I think a website like this is a good place to do so. Don't you agree?
